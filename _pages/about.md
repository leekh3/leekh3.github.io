My name is Kyunghun Lee.  I am a scientist at the National Institute of Health. I researched machine learning, software/hardware optimization, and automatic detection and classification system development while completing my Ph.D. at the University of Maryland. After that, I worked as a postdoctoral fellow (Diagnostic Radiology and Nuclear Medicine) at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and focused on leveraging machine learning and computational modeling to understand the relationship between brain and behavior, leading to novel therapeutic concepts for brain disorders and brain-inspired A.I. Here, I am working on computational analysis and software design in the lab and helping NIH researchers in every phase of the automated software workflow to use neuroscience to identify treatment targets. Also, I am working on software/algorithm development based on real-time information from wearable devices.

<!-- My name is Kyunghun Lee. I'm currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at [the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM)](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/), working with [Prof. Rong Chen](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Chen-Rong/).  -->
I completed my Ph.D. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.umd.edu/) (2018) at [the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD)](https://umd.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Shuvra S. Bhattacharyya](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~ssb/). My PhD research topics are broadly in the areas of machine learning and software implementations on devices. The topic of my research can be decomposed into two major, inter-related subproblems: (a) algorithm development, which encompasses the development or selection of supervised/unsupervised algorithms and optimization of their parameters, and (b) system development, which involves the mapping of the algorithms derived from (a) into real-time, energy efficient implementations on the targeted platforms. Also, this direction includes the development of model-based digital signal processing software. 

<!-- From 2014 through 2018, I worked with [US Army Research Laboratory (ARL)](https://www.arl.army.mil/) as a summer research intern.  I have worked with different datasets for different applications. For example, acoustic and seismic datasets have been used for surveillance applications (UMD and ARL). Currently, I am working on neural decoding algorithm developments and implementations based on brain-related features and image datasets (UMSOM and NIH).

<!-- My goal is to design/build better systems with usable security based on the emprical measurements of the security threats inherent in current our systems and networks. -->
