My name is Kyunghun Lee. I'm currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in University of Maryland School of Medicine, working with Professor [Rong Chen](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Chen-Rong/). 

My research interests are broadly in the areas of security and privacy. In particular, I empirically measure security threats in Public Key Infrastructures (e.g., the code signing PKI and the Web PKI), and design/build new better systems with usable security based on the empirical measurements. I have been awarded [the 5th annual NSA Best Scientific Cybersecurity Paper](https://cps-vo.org/group/sos/papercompetition) in usable security. My work about the code signing PKI has been featured in Ars Technica, The Register, Schneier on Security, Threatpost, etc. 

<!-- My goal is to design/build better systems with usable security based on the emprical measurements of the security threats inherent in current our systems and networks. -->
