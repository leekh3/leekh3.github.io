My name is Kyunghun Lee. I'm currently a Visiting Research Fellow (Computer Vision / Machine Learning Software Development) at High-Throughout Imaging Facility (HiTIF) in [National Cancer Institute (NCI)](https://www.cancer.gov/). Here, I have primarily developed image analysis software/algorithms by using image understanding/machine learning/deep learning background such as Mask R-CNN, UNET by using Python-Tensorflow/Keras/OpenCV and KNIME framework. Also, I have worked on data analysis and statistical understanding of different types of dataset. Also, I am helping biologists on the experimental set-up and to assist and help them in every phase of the automated imaging workflow. 

<!-- My name is Kyunghun Lee. I'm currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at [the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM)](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/), working with [Prof. Rong Chen](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Chen-Rong/).  -->
Before coming to NCI (NIH), I completed my Ph.D. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.umd.edu/) (2018) at [the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD)](https://umd.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Shuvra S. Bhattacharyya](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~ssb/). 

My PhD research topics are broadly in the areas of machine learning and software implementations on devices. The topic of my research can be decomposed into two major, inter-related subproblems: (a) algorithm development, which encompasses the development or selection of supervised/unsupervised algorithms and optimization of their parameters, and (b) system development, which involves the mapping of the algorithms derived from (a) into real-time, energy efficient implementations on the targeted platforms. Also, this direction includes the development of model-based digital signal processing software. 

<!-- From 2014 through 2018, I worked with [US Army Research Laboratory (ARL)](https://www.arl.army.mil/) as a summer research intern.  I have worked with different datasets for different applications. For example, acoustic and seismic datasets have been used for surveillance applications (UMD and ARL). Currently, I am working on neural decoding algorithm developments and implementations based on brain-related features and image datasets (UMSOM and NIH).

<!-- My goal is to design/build better systems with usable security based on the emprical measurements of the security threats inherent in current our systems and networks. -->
